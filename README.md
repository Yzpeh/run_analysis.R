Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This is a repository for the course project of the online course Getting and Cleaning Data from Coursera.

The R code is for creating a new tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject from the raw data.

After downloading the data from:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Extract it into the data directory under your R working directory.

You can run R code run_analysis.R or source it. It will generate a text file named "FinalData.txt". This is the required data set.

The data are obtained here:

The detailed explanation of the experiments is:

"The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain."

Which can be found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

The dataset includes the following files:

'README.txt'

'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

'features.txt': List of all features.

'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent.

'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.

'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis.

'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.

'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.

In this project I did not deal with the "Inertial Signals" data.

The Variables:

For each record in the dataset it is provided:

Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
Its activity label.
An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ tGravityAcc-XYZ tBodyAccJerk-XYZ tBodyGyro-XYZ tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ tBodyAccMag tGravityAccMag tBodyAccJerkMag tBodyGyroMag tBodyGyroJerkMag fBodyAcc-XYZ fBodyAccJerk-XYZ fBodyGyro-XYZ fBodyAccMag fBodyAccJerkMag fBodyGyroMag fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:

mean(): Mean value std(): Standard deviation mad(): Median absolute deviation max(): Largest value in array min(): Smallest value in array sma(): Signal magnitude area energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. iqr(): Interquartile range entropy(): Signal entropy arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4 correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window. angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean tBodyAccMean tBodyAccJerkMean tBodyGyroMean tBodyGyroJerkMean

The Transformations:

I first merged the training and the test sets to create one data set. Then I extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement, which are the variables with labels:

mean(): or std():

I added the descriptive activity names column to this data set and labelled the descriptive activity names according to 'activity_labels.txt'. I added the subject column to this data set and calcaluted the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. I stored the means in a new tidy data set. Finally, I wrote this tidy data set to a text file.
